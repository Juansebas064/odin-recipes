        <h1>Tamales</h1>
        <img src="../images/Tamal.jpg">
        <p>Traditional Mesoamerican dish made of masa, a dough made from nixtamalized corn, which is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaf. The wrapping can either be discarded prior to eating or used as a plate. Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, herbs, chilies, or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling and the cooking liquid may be seasoned.</p>

            <li>5 cups water</li>

            <li>String</li>
            <li>Water and Salt to cook the tamales</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Place all the marinade ingredients in the blender and blend until smooth. Reserve ½ cup of the marinade to prepare the masa.</li>
            <li>In a large plastic bowl place all the meat, add 1 ½ cups of the marinade. Mix well, cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Marinade meat</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the masa: Place the masarepa in a large bowl, add the water, salt, sazon Goya or color and reserved marinade. Mix well with a wooden spoon or your hands.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Masa</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the leaves well with hot water and set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Leaf</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To assemble the tamales: Place 1 piece of the leaf on a work surface and place a second leaf on top, pointing in the opposite direction, like forming a cross.</li>
            <li>Spread ¾ cup of masa in the center of the banana leaves, at the point where they connect and form a cross. Place 1 piece of pork, 1 piece pork belly and 1 piece of rib on top of the masa and place about 1 tablespoon of peas, 1 tablespoon of carrots and 2 tablespoons of potatoes on top of the meat.</li>
            <li>Fold the banana leaves up, one of the four sides at the time, so that the leaves enclose all of the filling, like you're making a package. Tie with butcher's string. Continue the process until all the tamales are wrapped and tied.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot with salted water to a boil. Add the tamales and then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 hour and 45 minutes. Remove the tamales from the pot and let them sit for about 5 minutes before serving. Cut the stirring and serve in the leaves. Serve hogao on the side if desired.</li>
